# Hotel Management System
**Project Description**
This Hotel Management System is a simple Java-based application designed to manage the operations of a hotel. 
It supports various functionalities such as room booking, food ordering, displaying room details, checking room availability, and checkout. 
The system is built using object-oriented programming principles and includes file handling for persistence.

The project allows the user to interact with the hotel system via the console.
The system can store and manage room details, check availability, perform bookings, and maintain food orders. 
Room types include Luxury Double Room, Deluxe Double Room, Luxury Single Room, and Deluxe Single Room.

## Features
**Room Display**: Displays the details of the room types (features such as amenities and prices).

**Room Availability**: Checks the availability of different room types.

**Room Booking**: Allows the user to book a room based on room type and availability.

**Food Ordering**: Orders food based on room number.

**Checkout**: Performs the checkout for a given room, deallocating the room and freeing up the space.

**Persistence**: Uses file handling to store room booking information across sessions.

## Technologies Used
Java: Core programming language for the application.
File Handling: For storing and retrieving hotel booking data.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Employed for room and booking structure.

## Installation & Prerequisites
Java 8 or higher installed on your system.

An IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code.

## Usage
The program will prompt you to enter a choice from the menu:

1: Display room details

2: Check room availability

3: Book a room

4: Order food for the room

5: Checkout and deallocate room

6: Exit the program

For each operation, the system will guide you to enter necessary information like room number or type.

The system will maintain persistent data through file handling. If the application is restarted, previous booking data will still be available.


## Future Contributions
Feature Expansion: You can extend the project by implementing a GUI using JavaFX or Swing.

Database Integration: For more scalability, you can integrate a database (e.g., MySQL or SQLite) to store room and booking data.
